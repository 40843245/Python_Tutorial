# Unicode
In this folder, I will place some my learning about presentation of a letter with unicode in Python.
## Additional Reference
For more details about Unicode, see README.md in repo named ComputerScience at GitHub, which availables at 

https://github.com/40843245/ComputerSceience/blob/main/Letter/Letter%20handling/Unicode/README.md

Furthermore, I recommend you to spend some time on looking my notes in this repo if you don't know (and would like to know) about Unicode.
