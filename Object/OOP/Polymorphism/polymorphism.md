# Polymorphism
## What is an polymorphism in class?

Polymorphism means multiple forms.

Image the situation in your daily life.

You love pets.

So, you have lots of pets. You have a dog, a cat and a snake.

Dogs can bark (saying bark).

Cats can mow (saying mow).

Snakes can hiss (saying hiss).

You put your favorite pets into same big cage.

In one day, one of your friend visit you, watching your favorite pets.

Then ask you, what are sounds of your favorite snake?

You hope the friend listening to the real sound. 

So, you search all your cage, finding the snake and then you require it to hiss.

Just for listening to one sound, you have to search all your cage. 

It wastes many time, does it?

Here, I come up with a better idea to save your time.

First, you record sounds of each pet.

Second, rename the file and put them into same folder.

After that, when one wants to listening the sounds, you just have to play the files.

Some readers may think that what is the relationship between the story and concepts of polymorphism.

If you don't use the techinique polymorphism, you have to directly write the name of the objects. 

If you do, you don't have to directly write the name of objects.

The code in the following link is an example of polymorphism in C++.
