# Encapsulation
## What is an encapsulation in class?

In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. 

In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.


It encapsulates many methods in many different class (BUT the name of the methods we encapsulate of each classes must be same).

Image the situation in your daily life.

You love pets.

So, you have lots of pets. You have a dog, a cat and a snake.

Dogs can bark (saying bark).

Cats can mow (saying mow).

Snakes can hiss (saying hiss).

You put your favorite pets into same big cage.

You encapsulate them into same big cage.

## Advantage
Although one writes more code, it is more easily to read and understand

and provide a way to access for a variable whose protection level is private, making it safer.
