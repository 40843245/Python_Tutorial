# Inheritence
## What is inheritence?
Inheritence is a technique for a class that inherits its attributes and methods from other class.

Like a child inherits the assets of one's parents.

With the techniuqe of inheritence, we don't have to write attributes and methods again.

## Term
1. Superclass or called base class: A class that is inherited from other class.

2. Subclass or called derived class: A class that inherits to other class.

NOTE that 
A class may be a super class or derived class in multi-level inheritence class.

Thus, it is 

1.more convenient to develop, 

2.easily to debug,

3.high usability, and

4.more maintenable.
